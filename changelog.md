## [0.5.3] - 2024-12-19

### üö® Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed subdirectory hosting navigation** - App now works correctly when hosted in subdirectories like `/PassAndPlaySH/`
- **Resolved "could not load setup page" error** - Start New Game button now navigates to correct setup page
- **Fixed browser history URLs** - Navigation now creates proper relative paths instead of absolute paths
- **Corrected service worker registration** - Service worker now registers with correct base path for subdirectory hosting
- **Fixed 404 errors on page refresh** - Pages like `/setup` now work correctly when refreshed
- **Improved SPA routing** - Service worker now handles direct URL access and redirects to index.html
- **Route restoration** - App automatically detects current route from URL and restores page state on load

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced base path detection** - App automatically detects when hosted in subdirectory and adjusts all URLs accordingly
- **Updated PWA manifest** - Fixed absolute paths in `start_url`, `scope`, and shortcut URLs to work with subdirectory hosting
- **Improved service worker caching** - All cached file paths now use correct base path for subdirectory hosting
- **Fixed notification icon paths** - Push notification icons now use correct base path
- **Enhanced service worker** - Added navigation request handling for SPA routing
- **URL-based page restoration** - App can now restore any page state from the URL on initial load
- **Better error handling** - Graceful fallback to index.html for missing routes

### üìÅ Files Modified
- `js/app.js` - Fixed `navigateToPage` method to use proper base paths and updated service worker registration
- `manifest.json` - Changed all absolute paths (`/`) to relative paths (`./`) for subdirectory compatibility
- `sw.js` - Added dynamic base path detection and updated all cached file paths

### üêõ Issues Resolved
1. **Navigation to wrong URLs** - Fixed by implementing proper base path detection in `navigateToPage` method
2. **Service worker registration failure** - Fixed by using correct base path for service worker registration
3. **PWA manifest compatibility** - Fixed absolute paths that prevented proper PWA functionality in subdirectories
4. **Caching issues** - Service worker now caches files from correct locations when hosted in subdirectories
5. **Notification icon paths** - Push notification icons now display correctly in subdirectory hosting
6. **404 errors on page refresh** - Fixed by improving SPA routing and route restoration

### üåê Hosting Compatibility
- **Subdirectory hosting support** - App now works correctly when hosted at paths like `http://localhost/PassAndPlaySH/`
- **Relative path navigation** - All internal navigation now uses relative paths that work regardless of hosting location
- **Dynamic base path detection** - App automatically adapts to different hosting configurations

### üîç Root Cause Analysis
The navigation issues were caused by hardcoded absolute paths throughout the application:
1. **Primary Issue**: `navigateToPage` method creating absolute URLs like `/setup` instead of `/PassAndPlaySH/setup`
2. **Secondary Issues**: Service worker registration, PWA manifest, and caching all using absolute paths
3. **Hosting Impact**: Absolute paths work only when app is hosted at root domain, not in subdirectories

### ‚úÖ Verification
- Start New Game button now correctly navigates to setup page
- Browser history shows correct URLs with proper base path
- Service worker registers and caches files from correct locations
- PWA manifest works properly in subdirectory hosting
- All internal navigation between game pages functions correctly
- Pages now work correctly when refreshed in the browser
- No more 404 errors when using browser back/forward or refreshing
